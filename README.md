# Oregon Trail Bot


### What is Oregon Bot?

OregonBot is a discord RPG bot based on the classic 70s' game "The Orgeon Trail".

### Self-hosting.

*Instructions to install the bot for your own personal use*

Install the repository, then unzip it.

Then open your command line, and make sure to locate the file location.

Once you've done that, run 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.

Once all the modules finish loading, create a file named `.env` in the bot's folder.

Make sure to add your bot's information in the file.

Example:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
DISCORD_PREFIX=o;
DEVELOPERS=388811685156093953
```
Once you're done with that, open command prompt and locate the folder again, then run `python main.py`, then your bot should be online!
